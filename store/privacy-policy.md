# Privacy Policy — rsvprdr

**Last updated:** February 19, 2026

## The Short Version

rsvprdr does not collect, store, or transmit any of your data. Period.

## Details

### Data Collection
rsvprdr collects **no data** from you. No personal information, no browsing history, no usage statistics — nothing.

### Text Processing
When you select text and open the RSVP reader, that text is processed **entirely on your device**. It never leaves your browser. No text is sent to any server, API, or third party.

### Local Storage
The only thing rsvprdr stores is your **reading speed preference (WPM)**, saved locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local`. This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not synced to any server
- Is not accessible to anyone but you
- Can be cleared at any time by removing the extension

### Analytics & Tracking
There are none. No analytics scripts, no tracking pixels, no telemetry, no fingerprinting. rsvprdr doesn't phone home.

### Third Parties
rsvprdr does not integrate with, send data to, or receive data from any third-party services.

### Changes
If this policy ever changes, the update will be reflected here with a new date. But honestly, "we don't collect your data" is a pretty stable policy.
