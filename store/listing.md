## Full Description

**Read faster. Retain more. No fluff.**

rsvprdr turns any text on the web into a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream — one word at a time, right where you are. Select text, right-click, and start reading at your pace.

### How It Works
1. **Select** any text on a webpage
2. **Right-click** → "Read with rsvprdr"
3. **Read** at your chosen speed in a clean overlay

### Features
- ⚡ **Adjustable WPM** — from leisurely 150 to blazing 800+ words per minute
- 🎯 **ORP Highlighting** — the optimal recognition point of each word is highlighted in red, so your eye locks on instantly
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** — play/pause, speed up, slow down, skip forward/back — all without touching your mouse
- 🎨 **Minimal Overlay** — reads on top of the page, no tab switching, no distractions
- 🔒 **Fully Private** — zero data collection, zero tracking, everything stays on your machine

### Why RSVP?
Traditional reading wastes time on eye movement between words. RSVP eliminates that by presenting words one at a time in a fixed position. Combined with ORP highlighting, your brain processes each word faster with less effort.

### Perfect For
- Long articles you want to get through quickly
- Research and study material
- Catching up on newsletters and blog posts
- Anyone curious about speed reading without the learning curve

Your reading speed is saved locally and remembered between sessions. That's the only thing stored — no accounts, no cloud, no nonsense.
